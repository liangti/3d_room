I shade a 3d room scene
This is the homework of a course called computer graphic. The code was based on opengl. And I achieve a 3d room with tellurion, 
vase,table and dragon. 
You can press up,down,left and right button to control the lamp,a white ball. And you can press a,d,w,s to change your viewport.

First,you have to do is build a win32 console project in vs2013 and make sure glext.h was in your include file.
Then,set project property. Change the characterset from using unicode to using wide character.
Last, solve the problem caused by file stream.

However, there is still a lot of bug. For example, I can't draw the chair because it will cause some error while translating. 
And the shadow is not accurately. Maybe someone could help me.
